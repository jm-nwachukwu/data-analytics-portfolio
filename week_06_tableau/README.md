# Tableau Sales Dashboard - April 2019

## Objective

Build a clean, executive-level Tableau dashboard to communicate sales performance and revenue drivers using a single transactional dataset.

## Dataset
April 2019 sales data containing order-level transactions, including product, city, quantity ordered, price, and revenue.

The same cleaned dataset used in the Python analysis (Weeks 5–6) was reused here to focus purely on visualization and communication.

## Dashboard Components

- **Daily Revenue Trend** - highlights revenue volatility and peak sales days

- **Revenue by City** - shows geographic concentration of revenue

- **Revenue by Product** - reveals revenue dependence on high-value products

- **City Filter** - enables quick comparison across locations

## Key Insights

- Revenue is not evenly distributed across the month, with clear daily peaks and dips

- A small number of cities contribute a disproportionate share of total revenue

- High-revenue products drive overall performance more than high-volume products

## Business Use Case

This dashboard is designed for executives and stakeholders who need a fast, high-level view of sales performance to support decisions around location strategy, inventory focus, and revenue monitoring.

## Tools Used

- Tableau Public
