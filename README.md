# Data Analytics Portfolio

This repository documents my progression from foundational Python skills to end-to-end business data analysis and executive storytelling using real-world datasets.

The work is structured as a **cumulative learning and analysis journey**, where each notebook builds on the previous ones. Notebooks are the primary artifacts; GitHub serves as an index and delivery layer.

## 📁 Project Structure & Notebooks

### **Week 01 — Python & Tabular Thinking**
**Notebook:**  
- `week_01/week_01_python_and_tabular_thinking.ipynb`

**Focus:**
- Fundamentals of Python logic and data structures  
- Understanding how Python represents tabular business data  
- Extracting insights from structured data using core Python concepts  

---

### **Week 02 — Pandas & CSV Analysis**
**Notebook:**  
- `week_02/week_02_pandas_and_csv.ipynb`

**Focus:**
- Reading and exploring CSV files with pandas  
- Filtering, grouping, and aggregating structured datasets  
- Introduction to DataFrames and basic visualizations  

**Dataset:**
- `sales_data.csv` (included in the folder)

---

### **Weeks 03 & 04 — Sales Analysis Case Study**
**Notebook:**  
- `week_03&04/sales_analysis_case_study.ipynb`

**Focus:**
- Cleaning and analyzing a real-world transactional dataset (18,000+ rows)  
- Identifying event-driven sales patterns and revenue volatility  
- Translating analysis into business insights and actionable recommendations  

**Dataset Source:**
- Public April 2019 sales dataset  
  (imported directly from an external GitHub repository)

---

### **Weeks 05 & 06 — Visualization, Storytelling & Executive Insights**
**Notebook:**  
- `week_05 & 06/sales_analysis_exploration.ipynb`

**Focus:**
- Revenue and demand analysis across products and cities  
- Data visualization to support business questions  
- Identifying pricing vs demand dynamics  
- Communicating insights through structured narratives  
- Writing an executive summary for decision-makers  

This notebook emphasizes **how analysis is communicated**, not just performed.

## 📌 How to Navigate This Repository
- Start from **Week 01** to see foundational thinking
- Progress sequentially to observe increasing analytical depth
- Each notebook is self-contained and includes:
  - Clear business questions
  - Data preparation steps
  - Visualizations
  - Interpreted insights

---

## 📝 Notes on Workflow
- Notebooks are the primary analytical artifacts  
- GitHub README files act as navigational dashboards  
- Insights are written inside notebooks first, then summarized here  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Deeper statistical reasoning
- Advanced visualization techniques
- Transition into predictive modeling and machine learning
